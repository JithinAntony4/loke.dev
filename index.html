      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>It looks so good, I might as well not stop. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. We don't have anything but happy trees here. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.</p>
      <p>The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator.</p>
      <p>Just use the old one inch brush. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. There it is. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.</p>
      <p>This is the fun part This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. And right there you got an almighty cloud. We have a fantastic little sky! Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. This is gonna be a happy little seascape.</p>
      <p>Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.</p>
      <p>We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Let the paint work. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.</p>
      <p>Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. We need dark in order to show light. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.</p>
