> *Psychill, psybient, cosmic chill, spiritual downtempo, progressive minimal instrumental...*

There are a lot of words that can try to describe this collection of wonder, but the only fair thing is for you to give it a real good listen and experience it for yourself.

The Swedish band **Carbon Based Lifeforms** is the foundation for this playlist and is what would eventually turn into Slothmode. It was always CBL that has been a reference point when deciding on what music to add or not. I wanted to have very minimum to none vocals in this playlist to make it a good choice when it was time to focus on for example programming. The major exception to the vocal rule is the band **Younger Brother** that I feel uses vocals without disturbing the focus. Additionally I like how Younger Brother is introducing a little different touch to this playlist which is quite downtemp normally.

These are some of the bands that defines what makes this playlist *Slothmode*:

\- Carbon based Lifeforms

\- Younger Brother

\- AES DANA

\- Solar Fields

\- Sync24

\- Cell

\- MIKTEK

\- H.U.V.A. Network

Currently consists of 265 songs that make up this 33 hour long playlist.
